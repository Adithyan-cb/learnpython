# Roadmap for Python 

## 1. Learn Syntax and Basics

Firstly start with the installation of Python in your system. Just visit on Python’s official site, download the latest version and you are good to go. 

Once the installation has completed, you may use IDLE to write and run Python code. Now we are going to list out some topics to start with learning Python. It will take almost 1 – 1.5 weeks to cover all the basic stuff still it depends on your learning process.

- The Python shell, basic arithmetic.
- Control structures.
- Accepting user input, Strings & Typecasting.
- Looping in Python: For & While loops.
- Exception handling.
- Functions, modules & Imports.

## 2. OOPs Concepts, Built-in Data Structures, and Other Stuff

This section will be a bit tough especially if you don’t know about object-oriented programming concepts. Take the help of some resources which we have mentioned and with some practice, you will be able to understand the concepts. 

These concepts will be widely used in making complex applications so understand these topics very well. It may take 1 – 1.5 weeks to learn.

- Object oriented programming in Python
- Lists & List functions
- Regular Expressions
- List comprehension
- List slicing
- String formatting
