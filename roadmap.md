# Roadmap for Python 

## 1. Learn Syntax and Basics

Firstly start with the installation of Python in your system. Just visit on Python’s official site, download the latest version and you are good to go. 

Once the installation has completed, you may use IDLE to write and run Python code. Now we are going to list out some topics to start with learning Python. 

_It will take almost 1 – 1.5 weeks to cover all the basic stuff._
- The Python shell, basic arithmetic.
- Control structures.
- Accepting user input, Strings & Typecasting.
- Looping in Python: For & While loops.
- Exception handling.
- Functions, modules & Imports.
---
## 2. OOPs Concepts, Built-in Data Structures, and Other Stuff

This section will be a bit tough especially if you don’t know about object-oriented programming concepts. Take the help of some resources which we have mentioned and with some practice, you will be able to understand the concepts. 

These concepts will be widely used in making complex applications so understand these topics very well. 

_It may take 1 – 1.5 weeks to learn_.

- Object oriented programming in Python
- Lists & List functions
- Regular Expressions
- List comprehension
- List slicing
- String formatting
- Lambdas
- List, Dictionaries & Tuples

## 3. Frameworks for Web Development

There are so many frameworks for web applications in Python some of them are Django, Flask, Bottle, Tornado, and Pyramid.

### Django:
A high level web framework mostly used in startups and enterprise for web development. It follows the MVC pattern and you can use multiple databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle. 

If you are a complete beginner and not aware of the terminology authentication, URL routing, API and models then you will feel a lot of pain while learning Django but take your time, have patience, go through some more resources and understand each line of code. Slowly and gradually you will understand everything.

_Learning Django may take 2 – 2.5 weeks._


### Flask: 

Flask is one of the easiest microframework to learn in Python. If you wish to develop a simple and lightweight web application then Flask is suitable for that. It is not as powerful and extensive as Django still provides features such as support for unit testing and building REST APIs. 

_Learning Flask will take 1 – 1.5 weeks._
